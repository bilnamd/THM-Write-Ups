# THM-Write-Ups
Welcome to my repository of write-ups for Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on TryHackMe (THM) platform! 

## About me 
My name is Nabil, and I'm a final-year student in network engineering at a French engineering school, as well as an experienced network and security engineer in an alternating work-study program. I'm passionate about cybersecurity and particularly interested in offensive security, with a focus on penetration testing.

## Why am I doing this?
To improve my skills and knowledge in this field, I'm actively practicing on various platforms and online courses, and participating in CTFs. TryHackMe is one of my favorite platforms, as it offers a wide range of realistic and educational challenges for beginners and advanced learners alike, with a friendly community and a gamified interface. I've solved many challenges on THM, and I've decided to share my solutions and thought process with others who may benefit from them.

## The content of the repository
In this repository, you'll find my write-ups for THM challenges, organized by level of difficulty. Each write-up includes a detailed explanation of the challenge's objectives, methods, and tools used, as well as screenshots, commands, and code snippets. I've tried to make them as clear and concise as possible, without spoiling the fun of the challenge itself or violating any terms of service.


Feel free to use my write-ups as a reference, a guide, or a source of inspiration for your own learning journey. 

If you have any feedback, suggestion, or question about my write-ups or my profile, don't hesitate to contact me.
I'm always eager to learn and connect with like-minded people, and to contribute to the community in any way I can.
